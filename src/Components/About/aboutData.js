        "Hey, welcome to my web! I'm currently working as a Data Engineer at a fintech start up called Micah! Our company provides a web platform for bank lenders to interface with their customers. Although my job title is formally data engineer, I have mostly been working on backend features. I found to really enjoy working in the backend and will most likely tailor my career more towards software than data.",
        "Aside from my full-time position, I am also a part-time computer science Masters student at Georgia Tech with a specialization in machine learning. I'm expecting to graduate in Spring 2024; after 3 long years. While I have my reservations about academics and the pursuit for higher education, I got to meet a lot of amazing people and gain fundamental knowledge in a field I pivoted to.",
        'Given my prior experience in the fire industry, I have also been fortunate enough to contribute part-time at a non-profit. IPSDI is a non-profit that "procures, assembles, analyzes, and reports information from fire, rescue, and law enforcement data." While I do have a lot on my plate, I only commit around 5 to 10 hrs per week outside of work hours. This helps me give back to the community as well as supplement a more diverse software experience.',
        "In my personal time, I love to play games like Valorant and Apex Legends. Gaming helps exercise my decision-making and awareness. As a poor example, when I'm driving I refer to my rear-view mirror as my mini-map and try to be aware of all the cars around me. When it's time to make a lane change, I know I can be confident that my blind-spot is clear. In the winter season, I am an avid snowboarder. I'm an Epic season pass holder and have been to Whistler, Breckinrige, Keystone, Vail, Beaver Creek, Palisades, Kirkwood, North Star, Heavenly, Steven's Pass, Mammoth Mountain, and June Mountain. I also love to play tennis and go bowling when I get the chance. And finally after all that, if I have time, I am passionate about my personal projects and Medium blogs! Check out my active & previous projects out in the projects tab."

        "Legos. I'm a victim to their mission statement, 'to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow.' I became a prisoner to the dopamine rush of opening that new Lego set and committing the next several hours to follow their prescribed instructions. After the instruction booklet vanished, I couldn't help but cannibalize and improvise with other sets to exercise my creativity. They show you how their engineers would design a structure and then encourage you to try alternative methods. Lego introduced me to spatial reasoning, structural integrity, and fundamental engineering concepts. ",
        "Behind the scenes, there's so many levels of engineering that goes into Legos. From robotics to model designers to mass manufacturing techniques. The whole life cycle of Legos inspired me to be an engineer. Aside from toys, I've always looked to devise solutions for daily grinds. I made a basketball chute for dirty clothes to help promote laundry collection. I made a pulley system around my room so I could turn off the lights remotely from my bed. I made an electric skateboard so I didn't have to walk in the heat. These solutions weren't derived from aspiring to be an engineer, I just looked for practical solutions for relevant problems. ",
        "Just like legos, I want to stack foundational building blocks together to mature into a well-rounded engineer. I chose mechanical engineering because of the fundamental diversity and application to problem-solving holistically. I'm always looking to expand my skillset, even outside of mechanical engineering. But most importantly, I'm looking to have fun with my career. Remember... growing up doesn't mean you stop playing with Legos, it just means buying your own."

        "I've always loved making tools. Growing up as a kid, computers were new and under-developed. These were the days when Netflix used to mail DVD's. The only tools accessible to me were all mechanical: kitchen gadgets, vehicles, legos, furniture, etc. However, as I matured, so did software. I got to see the digital age develop firsthand. And soon, the need for more software tools became apparent. This original passion to develop tools to increase quality of life still carries on. Whether it be making apps or constructing scalable infrastructure to support data scientists and software engineers; this is my carrer goal."
