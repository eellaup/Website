        "Hey, welcome to my web! I'm currently working as a mechanical engineer in a startup with one of my professors and mentors from UT. I decided to make a website in ReactJS for fun, and hopefully for you to get to know me a little better.",
        "I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin as a Mechanical Engineer in 2018. I tailored my academic career heavily towards graduate school, and luckily got accepted to Georgia Tech (joint with Seoul National University) and The University of Michigan. But about three weeks before I graduated, I decided not to go. I feared pigeon-holing myself in career path I hardly knew about. Instead I began soul-searching in industry.",
        "In June 2018, I started my first job at Tesla as a quality technician for the Model 3 battery module. In October 2018, I received the Quality Employee of the Quarter Award for participating in designing, managing, and leading a pilot production line that saved the company over $10M. After that project, I deployed several applications packaged in Java, Python and MySQL for quick & easy data analysis on manufacturing root-cause analysis. These apps were praised by engineers, managers, and fellow technicians. Soon after, I internally transfered to the Quality Data Science and Systems team for all of Gigafactory 1."

        // "When I chose to be an engineer, there wasn't an inspirational story or event behind it. I simply liked creating things and solving problems. I specifically chose mechanical for its diversity and fundamental application to problem-solving holistically. "
        "Legos. I'm a victim to their mission statement, 'to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow.' I became a prisoner to the dopamine rush of opening that new Lego set and committing the next several hours to follow their prescribed instructions. After the instruction booklet vanished, I couldn't help but cannibalize and improvise with other sets to exercise my creativity. They show you how their engineers would design a structure and then encourage you to try alternative methodologies. Lego introduced me to spatial reasoning, structural integrity, and fundamental engineering concepts. ",
        "Behind the scenes, there's so many levels of engineering that goes into Legos. From robotics to model designers to mass manufacturing techniques. The whole life cycle of Legos inspired me to be an engineer. Aside from toys, I've always looked to devise solutions for daily grinds. I made a basketball chute for dirty clothes to help promote laundry collection. I made a pulley system around my room so I could turn off the lights remotely from my bed. I made an electric skateboard so I didn't have to walk in the heat. These solutions weren't derived from aspiring to be an engineer, I just looked for realistic solutions for relevant problems. ",
        "Just like legos, I want to stack foundational building blocks together to mature into a well-rounded engineer. I chose mechanical engineering because of the fundamental diversity and application to problem-solving holistically. I'm always looking to expand my skillset, even outside of mechanical engineering. But most importantly, I'm looking to have fun with my career. Remember... growing up doesn't mean you stop playing with Legos, it just means buying your own."

        "I've always loved making tools. Growing up as a kid, computers were new and under-developed. These were the days when Netflix used to mail DVD's. The only tools accessible to me were all mechanical: kitchen gadgets, vehicles, legos, furniture, etc. However, as I matured, so did software. I got to see the digital age develop firsthand. And soon, the need for more software tools became apparent. This original passion to develop tools to increase quality of life still carries on. Whether it be making apps or constructing scalable infrastrucutre to support data scientists and software engineers: this is my carrer goal."
